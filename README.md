# Analyzing an A/B test results
## Introduction
Basically, A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of something to figure out which performs better. Though A/B testing is not limitted to websites and appluications, I am going to focus more on websites as since the  example here is on an A/B test carried on a website.
When marketers create landing pages, write email copy, or design call-to-action buttons,... it can be tempting to predic the possible turnout(clicks >> conversions) and take decisions base on intuitions. These kinds of decisions can be very risky and detrimental to business. You won't want to risk the whole business by taking decisions based on simple guesses. this is where A/B testing comes in!

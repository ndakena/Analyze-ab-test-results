# Analyzing an A/B test results
## Introduction
Basically, A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of something to figure out which performs better. Though A/B testing is not limited to websites and applications, I am going to focus more on websites as since the  example here is on an A/B test carried on a website.

----------------------------------------------------------------
When marketers create landing pages, write email copy, or design call-to-action buttons,... it can be tempting to predic the possible turnout(clicks >> conversions) and take decisions base on intuitions. These kinds of decisions can be very risky and detrimental to business. You won't want to risk the whole business by taking decisions based on simple guesses. this is where A/B testing comes in!

----------------------------------------------------------------
For instance, if you are testing the background color of your landing pages (or the entire look of the landing pages) to determine which one helps you generate the most conversions, you would want to use an A/B test. If you are testing at the page level, then you should be looking at the entire page as the variable.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Here, we'll be working to understand the results of an A/B test ran by an e-commerce website. The main goal is to help the company understand whether or not they should 
- Implement the new page
- Keep the old page, or 
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
